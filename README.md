<h2>CMPUT 656 Project: Revisiting Long-Tail Entities in News: A Modern Tool Approach</h2>
Refer to the requirements.txt file to view the necessary dependencies.

1. To begin the project, execute the Named Entity Recognition tool on the dataset. Refer to the Spacy_NER file for the codebase. Comments within the code file provide guidance on which blocks of code to execute. Results are captured in the output section of the notebook since it was used for the analysis

   
2. Next, execute the BLINK_Entity_Linking file to apply the entity linker, BLINK, to the dataset. Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies and refer to the comments within the code for instructions on execution. Results are captured in the output section of the notebook since it was used for the analysis

We do not provide the Signal -1M dataset or the subset used in this study within this repository as we do not have the necessary licensing for sharing
